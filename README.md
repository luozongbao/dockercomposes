# dockercomposes
Because of using container becoming a trend and getting more users everyday.  But running containers are not as easy as it seems, or it might take time to try and error, it is best to have a startter template for those systems that consisted of more than one systems.
I want to create a **docker compose library** so that it is easier/save time to run a system of famouse and frequently used systems.  In case that some folder contain .env file then **you should edit .env file for customization.**
